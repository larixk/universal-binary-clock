# Universal Binary Clock

A binary clock of seconds since the Big Bang

Time is represented as a 64-bit integer where each bit corresponds to a power of 2 seconds. The visualization displays an 8Ã—8 grid where each cell represents one bit position. Each second in the entire history of time has a unique binary representation in this grid.
